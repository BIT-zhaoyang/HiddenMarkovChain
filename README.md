# HiddenMarkovChain
This folder contains a detailed implementation of HMM described in PRML. The files contain three modules:      
  1. data generation     
  2. K-means for preprocess parameter selection     
  3. Alpha-Beta algorithm for learning parameters.

Since this is just a prototype for another more advanced method, the structure of the program is not carefully designed. I used a procedure based method rather than object based programming.
